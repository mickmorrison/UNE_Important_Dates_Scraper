# UNE_Important_Dates_Scraper
## Mick Morrison with OpenAi

 A simple but effective way to create an ical file using important dates from UNE academic calendar, solving the ridiculous situation that universities do not seem to release the academic calendar in an ICAL file, but prefer a stupid HTML table...

I'm sure there's lots more to do with this, including:
- Figuring out how to make events with a start and end date over multiple days


The script can be run with R and is designed to be self-contained, though no guarantees provided that it will work correctly on all systems. 

Note:

Users will need to:

- Update the URL if not wanting the UNE 2024 calendar
- Change the download location for the ical file to suit your local system

When loaded into Outlook Calendar, the pop-up import window says only the first event is listed (new years day) but, rest assured, all of the other cal events in the ical will also be imported.

It is recommended you import events to a separate calendar, not your primary one, so all can be deleted if you are unhappy at result. Otherwise, like me, you'll fill up a calendar with multiple events with the same name...
